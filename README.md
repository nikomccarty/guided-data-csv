# Introduction

# Downloading and Installing Anaconda
Begin by navigating to the [Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Anaconda. Click the Download button. Open the downloaded file. During the installation process, use the option to "Install for: Just Me." Use default settings during installation.

After installation, search your PC for Anaconda Navigator. Add to your Desktop. Launch the program.

When you launch Anaconda, you will see many "apps" available for launch, including Datalore, JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code, and others.

We will launch a "Notebook." Find the Notebook app, and click on Launch. Open it using Google Chrome.
